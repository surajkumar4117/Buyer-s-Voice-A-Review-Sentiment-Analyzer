## üö∞ End-to-End NLP Project ‚Äì Buyer‚Äôs Voice: A Review Sentiment Analyzer

**Buyer‚Äôs Voice** is a full-stack, NLP-powered sentiment analysis system designed to analyze customer product reviews and classify them into positive or negative sentiments. The project is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** and is capable of ingesting raw text input, performing deep preprocessing, and providing real-time predictions with explanations. This project is ideal for showcasing **NLP, ML deployment, and data pipeline skills** on your resume or portfolio.

### üì¶ Project Overview

This application is built around real-world business needs in e-commerce and customer analytics. It simulates how platforms like Amazon or Flipkart analyze millions of product reviews to extract customer sentiment and improve product/service decisions.

The system uses a combination of:

* Custom text preprocessing pipeline
* Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings
* Scikit-learn-based ML model (e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
* Streamlit for real-time interactivity
